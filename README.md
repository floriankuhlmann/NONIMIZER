# PHP NON-Transform Library

Welcome to the PHP NON-Transform Library, an funny open-source library that transforms any given text into a sequence of 'NON' strings, matching the original text's letter count while preserving spaces and punctuation. This library offers a playful way to encode messages, providing a straightforward and humorous approach to text transformation.

## Features

- **NON-Transform**: Converts text into sequences of 'NON', with each 'NON' representing a single letter from the original text.
- **Preserves Formatting**: Maintains the integrity of the original text's spaces, punctuation, and special characters.
- **Plug and Play**: Includes an `index.php` file for easy deployment on any PHP-supported web server or integration into existing PHP projects.

## Getting Started

To get started with the PHP NON-Transform Library, you need a working PHP environment. The library is compatible with PHP 5.3 and above.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your desired location, whether it's a local directory for development or your web server's root.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/php-non-transform.git


### How It Works
The NON-Transform Library takes each alphabetical character in the input text and replaces it with 'NON', while all spaces, punctuation, and special characters are left unchanged. This simple yet creative method allows for the encoding of messages in a fun and non-standard format.

### Example
Input: "Hello, world! This is a test."

Output: "NONNO, NNON! NONN NON a NONN."

This example illustrates how the library transforms each letter into 'NON' while keeping the structure of the original sentence intact.
